Here is a guide which should help. \r\n\r\n**Note**: this guide is subject to change depending on weather conditions and from runner to runner.\r\n\r\n- under 10 miles: 1 water bottle and 1-2 gel packets (or food of similar calories)\r\n- 10-15 miles: 1-2 water bottles (or hydration pack) and 2-3 gel packets and 1-2 salt tablets\r\n- 15-20 miles: 2-3 water bottles (or hydration pack) and 2 gels and one energy bar and 3-4 salt tablets\r\n\r\nPlease remember that this is a general guideline. Each runner has his or her own fueling needs. And more importantly weather conditions can make this guide fluctuate wildly.\r\n",
